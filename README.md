RRG Modifier - Single-die to 2.5D architecture
==============================

This RRG modifier can generate a 2.5D RRG for any input interposer wirelength.  

Usage
---------------

Some parts of this toolflow require external packages. Please contact us if you want more information.

To calculate point to point delays, vpr is used (see option --vpr_command). When compiling vpr, the macro PRINT_ARRAYS has to be defined in "place/timing_place_lookup.c".
